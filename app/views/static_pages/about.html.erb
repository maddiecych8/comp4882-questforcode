       <p class="lead">Computer science students often face difficulties learning the  concepts of algorithms, especially recursive algorithms. Sometimes, traditional learning methods are not effective in helping students fully understand these vital concepts. Instead of struggling to learn by these traditional methods, students may be more receptive to a more visual, interactive method of learning Computer Science concepts. Our game, Quest for Code, provides an alternative way to learn about and master recursive tree traversal algorithms. Recursive algorithms and tree traversal are two of the most basic, and often confusing, concepts in algorithms and programming courses. Quest for Code was designed to help teach these concepts and improve the learning experience.</p>
