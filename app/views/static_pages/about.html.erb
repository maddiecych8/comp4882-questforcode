       <p class="lead">The computer science students mostly face with the difficulties in learning the topics of algorithms courses. Only listening the topic from the teacher or just writing makes the learning volatile. Instead of listening or writing, if there is something visual, it would be more permanent to learn because visuality increases the learning potential and the time for learning is minimized. The adversities of classical education techniques were intended to be eliminated in this study via computer games which are becoming more and more popular in this age. An educational convenience is provided for the subject of tree traversal algorithms. Tree traversal algorithms are one of the basic and confused concepts in algorithms and programming courses in computer science. Quest for Code was established to teach and learn the subject easier.</p>
